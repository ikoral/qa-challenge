### BugId: 105

### Bug Description:

If we pass number 992 and greater than 992. UI does nothing, nothing changes. If you have the previous result on the screen it remains. The starting number is 992 as of the day this bug report is written.

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. Go to https://qainterview.pythonanywhere.com
2. Click input box and write 3 and click calculate button.
3. It will calculate the result as 6 as expected.
4. Clear 3 in the input box and write 1500 and click calculate button again.
5. It seems nothing happens on the UI.
6. Open browser developer tools and go to the console.
7. Clear your console.
8. On UI, repeat steps 2-5
9. You can see 500 Internal Server Error for the API call in your dev-tools.

This value (number 992 and greater than 992) returns an error from API endpoint but UI swallows this error and shows nothing.
