### BugId: 104

### Bug Description:

If we pass negative numbers, UI does nothing, nothing changes. If you have the previous result on the screen it remains.

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. Go to https://qainterview.pythonanywhere.com
2. Click input box and write 3 and click calculate button.
3. It will calculate the result as 6 as expected.
4. Clear 3 in the input box and write -3 and click calculate button again.
5. It seems nothing happens on the UI.
6. open browser developer tools and go to the console.
7. Clear your console.
8. On UI, repeat steps 2-5
9. You can see 500 Internal Server Error for the API call in your dev-tools.

This value (negative number) returns an error from API endpoint but UI swallows this error and shows nothing.
