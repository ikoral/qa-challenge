### BugId: 102

### Bug Description:

When we click the Terms and Condition link, it forwards page to Privacy page instead of Terms and Condition Page. See also screenshot.

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. Go to https://qainterview.pythonanywhere.com
2. Click **Terms and Condition** link.
3. Look at url. The page directs to **Privacy** page, not **Terms** page.

You may see wrong routing in the browser dev tools.
After step 1, open dev tools and find the element **Terms and Condition** link.
Look at _href_ value. It is **Privacy** endpoint not **Terms** endpoint.
