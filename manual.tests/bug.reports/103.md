### BugId: 103

### Bug Description:

When we click the Privacy link, it forwards page to Terms and Condition page instead of Privacy Page. See also screenshot.

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. Go to https://qainterview.pythonanywhere.com
2. Click **Privacy** link.
3. Look at url. The page directs to **Terms and Condition** page, not **Privacy** page.

You may see wrong routing in the browser dev tools.
After step 1, open dev tools and find the element **Privacy** link.
Look at _href_ value. It is **Terms** endpoint not **Privacy** endpoint.
