### BugId: 106

### Bug Description:

If we pass number number with decimal point such as 3.000 UI does nothing, nothing changes. If you have the previous result on the screen it remains.

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. Go to https://qainterview.pythonanywhere.com
2. Click input box and write 4 and click calculate button.
3. It will calculate the result as 24 as expected.
4. Clear 4 in the input box and write 2.000 and click calculate button again.
5. It seems nothing happens on the UI.
6. Open browser developer tools and go to the console.
7. Clear your console.
8. On UI, repeat steps 2-5
9. You can see 500 Internal Server Error for the API call in your dev-tools.

Number with decimal point returns an error from API endpoint but UI swallows this error and shows nothing.
