### BugId: 108

### Bug Description:

When we use api endpoint, "https://qainterview.pythonanywhere.com/factorial" and pass improper values to the API, it creates 500 Server error. But it does not help much what is missing or what went wrong. It could be improved and and we may have better error handling for API.

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open your API client such as insomnia or Postman
2. Create new `POST` request to https://qainterview.pythonanywhere.com/factorial
3. On Body use urlencoded option and write `number` as key
4. First provide a proper input such as 3 or 4.
5. Clear the value and pass a improper values, a negative number, a letter, number bigger then 1000
6. It always creates the same "500 Internal Server Error"
