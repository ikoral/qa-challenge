### BugId: 107

### Bug Description:

We can see some screen logs on the dev-tools console when we run the application.

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. Go to https://qainterview.pythonanywhere.com
2. Open browser developer tools and go to the console.
3. Click input box and write 3 and click calculate button.
4. it will print 3 and "Hello! I am in the done part of the ajax call" message and answer.

This bug does not effect any functionality but it is not nice to print some logs on the console if application is on production.
